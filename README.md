Reflect your historical data ( storage proof of ownership storage) into a .

## What is historical data ( storage proof of ownership )?

Historical data is proof of ownership based on past block. It is a record that contains "{#} address is the owner of {#} NFT at block number {#}".

For example, 0x30â€¦83 is the owner of #10 everAi NFT at block number #8893709 in Ethereum.

## What is StarkBadge?

StarkBadge is a L1 historical reflection of the L2 original NFT.The StarkBadge contract has the same functions as the original NFT, but with three differences:

1. It records the exact block number of the proof. You can generate historical data based on any historical block number, and it will be recorded on StarkBadge.
2. To mint a StarkBadge, you need to validate proof. As StarkBadge is a reflection, you need to verify that you hold a token and then have access to claim the reflection.
3. It validates the signature to make sure the right person is calling proof validation. StarkBadge stores the mapping of L1 and L2 wallets so that the right L1 address's proof is sent to the right L2 address. You need to check the mapping before proof validation.

Using the <b>Herodotus API</b>, the historical data you get from L1 can be verified in L2. On the StarkBadge page, you can choose which NFT {#} and which block number you want to make as historical data proof. You can also choose which one you want to claim in L2.
